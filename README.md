# CMStorm-KeyboardControl
A simple application to control the Cooler Master CM Storm Devastator LEDs via the System Tray in Ubuntu Linux.

# About
In late 2015 I picked up the CM Storm Devastator Gaming Keyboard/Mouse Combo that was on sale.  It's a great keyboard, however the Scroll Lock button, which also turns on the the LED backlit keys, doesn't work in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (which I am currently using).  

After doing some searching I found some solutions - but most seemed to be a bit of a comprimise, such as remapping the Scroll Lock key permanently. Some solutions would even turn the numberpad on the far-right in to a d-pad for the mouse on screen.  Later I found a simple command that would fix that problem, but it still felt 'cumbersome' to always have to log into a terminal and type on a command just to turn the LEDs on and off.

My frustration eventually resulted in me creating this simple helper app that allows a user to control their keyboard lighting in the Ubuntu Unity system tray (and other GTK-based environments).
